# WhiteBoard

This was a project for my advanced Java programming class. It basically an interactive version of MS paint with a chat window. Two people can connect to each other using the program and paint and communicate.

More information about this project can be found on [my website](http://dl-thompson.com/2013-04-29-Java-Programming-Interactive-Whiteboard/)
